# Plan Your Dishes for the Week

See the [user story document](stories.md) for a list of problems I want to solve with this app. It is planned for private, non-commercial use and probably won't ever support multi-tenancy. However, eventually it might be possible to run local versions of the app with your own dishes or use cookies or file up- and download to make to enable more than one person to use this app in a meaningful way :)

Visit the current build of the app [here](https://peregrintooc.github.io/what-should-we-eat/index.html). The app currently only supports german as a language.
